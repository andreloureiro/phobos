# Phobos


A ClojureScript wrapper to use Velocity React in Reagent apps. With Phobos you can easily add transitions to your UI.

## Usage

First, add Phobos to your project dependencies:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/phobos/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/phobos)

Phobos has 2 components: `motion-component` and `motion-group`. Both accepts a map with configs as its first argument, and the child component our collection of components as its second argument.

### `motion-component`

If you need to animate one component, you should go with `motion-component`. It accepts the following properties:

* `animation`: Animation config
* `target-query-selector`: Used to animate a descendant of the child component.
* `run-on-mount`: Run the animation when the component is mounted.

Other properties like `duration`, `delay`, `loop` etc are passed directly to Velocity.js.

### `motion-group`

Wraps the `VelocityTransitionGroup` component. Useful when you want to apply transitions for items in a list when they are inserted and/or removed. You can apply the following properties to the wrapper:

* `enter`: Animation config for execution in the time that the component is mounted.
* `leave`: Same as `enter`, but for unmounting components.
* `run-on-mount`: Run the animation when the component is mounted.

As with `motion-component`, other properties like `component`, `class-name`, etc are passed directly as props to the `ReactTransitionGroup` component.


## Transitions

For the transitions, you have two options: Ready-to-use Velocity pre-registered UI Pack effects, or create your own.

If you go with the later, you can use a function `register-effect` provided by Phobos. You can define a custom Velocity UI Pack effect to use with the `animation` property of both `motion-component` and `motion-group` components. You have some advantages over declaring your animations as style hashes, like animation chaining. You can get more information in the [Velocity UI Pack](http://julian.com/research/velocity/#uiPack) section of Velocity.js site.

But if the provided pre-registered animations are enough for you to achieve what you need, you can check the available effects [here](https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/blob/master/velocity.ui.js#L224).
